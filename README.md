The file named `Beautybook v6.0.cls` is the Chinese version, conversely, the file named `Beautybook v6.0 En.cls` is the English one.
They should be complied by the `xelatex` engine, no matter Chinese version or not.
- For the packages `mtpro2` and `twemojis`, if they are not installed on your Pc/Mac, you should delete them before compilation.
